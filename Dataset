# 📁 Static and Dynamic Environment Image Dataset for Humanoid Robots

This repository contains documentation and download links for a dataset of images representing **static** and **dynamic** environments. The dataset is specifically prepared to support research on the **enhancement of real-time ball detection for humanoid robots**, particularly in disaster-prone or complex terrains.

---

## 📷 Dataset Overview

The dataset is divided into two main categories:

### 1. **Static Environments**
- Images depict unmoving scenes such as rubble, obstacles, or narrow pathways.
- Useful for evaluating the humanoid robot's stability and visual perception under fixed conditions.
- Image resolution: 640x480 pixels  
- Format: `.jpg`

### 2. **Dynamic Environments**
- Images contain visual disturbances or changing elements such as uneven terrain or moving objects.
- Designed to test robustness of real-time detection systems under challenging environmental variations.
- Image resolution: 640x480 pixels  
- Format: `.jpg`
